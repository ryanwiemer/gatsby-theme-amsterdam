**Gatsby Theme Amsterdam** was designed to be a minimal
and clean theme geared towards photographers, artists and other
creative folks. Inspired by the capital city of the Netherlands known
for its artistic heritage, impressive architecture and canals that
criss-cross the city. Truthfully I have never visited before but it
sounds like a pretty cool place so I decided to use the name.
